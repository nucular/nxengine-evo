NXEngine-evo
============

This is a somewhat rewrite/refactored version of nxengine
It tends to be more portable and use cleaner code.

What done:

* Port to SDL2 ( thanks to https://github.com/PIlin/NXEngine-iOS )
* More resolutions and widescreen support up to FullHD (thanks to https://github.com/EXL/NXEngine )
* Fullscreen for any resolution
* Gamepad with force-feedback support.
* Header-dependency hell cleaned up. No more autogenerated headers
* Cleaned up nx.h
* Lists/maps from haiku replaced with std::vector/map
* smalfont -> smallfont
* removed built-in data extractor
* removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway

Look in TODO for upcoming features

May (and most definitely) contain bugs.

Building
--------

**Requirements**
- [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
- [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
- Optional, if you want TTF font support:
  - [SDL2_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf)
  - [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/)
  - [zlib](http://www.zlib.net)

```sh
cd build
cmake -G"Your Generator" ..
make
```

`Your Generator` will be `Unix Makefiles` for GCC, `MinGW Makefiles` for MinGW
and `NMake Makefiles` for VS/NMake.  
If you want to build without TTF font support, pass `-DUSE_TTF=OFF` to cmake
(before the `..`).

After the build has finished, copy `data/` and `Doukutsu.exe` from the original
Cave Story to `build/` and run `extract` to generate the nescessary game files.

If you're on Windows, copy `SDL2.dll`, `libpng3.dll` and, if built with TTF font
support, `SDL2_ttf.dll`, `libfreetype-6.dll` and `zlib1.dll` to `build/`.

Now you should be all set to run `nx`.
